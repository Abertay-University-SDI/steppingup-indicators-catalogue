#Stepping Up Indicators Catalogue
This interative visualisation, known as The Catalogue of Sustainability Indicators, gives an indication of how each of three innovations can support nexus goals across the sectors of Water, Energy and Food and links to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs. It also highlights important indicators of sustainability across the 3 pillars, ie Environmental, Economic and Social and where these indicators act as a driver or barrier to the scaling up of the innovation. 

The catalogue of indicators is part of the Decision Support Toolkit that was developed as part of the [Stepping Up project](http://steppingupnexus.org.uk). We have deliberately avoided focussing too much on economic factors as this was not the focus of the project, a number of other tools exist for this purpose.  

We have tried to give an indication of how the three different innovations could promote sustainability and also to give an indication of how the 3 possible future scenarios (based on the UK in 2050) could impact this.
