				<h2>Towards a Sustainable Water-Energy-Food Nexus</h2>
				<section id="about">
					<h3>The Problem</h3>
					<p>
					The production and consumption of food is one of the most significant contributors to climate change today. Future predictions of population growth to 11bn by 2100 and the “Westernisation” of the global diet to include more meat, means that by 2050 we will almost be blowing our carbon budget in growing food alone. Attention is increasingly turning to alternative sources of protein, what to do with food waste and how to minimise it.

				<h2>The Innovations</h2>
				<p>
				These innovations are linked by the common theme of waste, which can simultaneously be considered both a burden and, increasingly, a resource. While the production of some waste is inevitable, reducing the amount of waste we produce could significantly reduce environmental burdens, both up and downstream. Developing new markets and supply chains to repurpose waste streams has the potential to address nexus-related challenges in different ways.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the context of increasing resource scarcity and rising greenhouse gas emissions, these particular innovations have the potential to offer insights into the development of new resources across a number of applications. Building case studies around those innovations will offer us interesting insights into technical, systemic, production driven and consumer driven practices of innovation at different levels of maturity. We will be able to explore how issues of governance (policies, politics, institutions and behaviours) relate to the generation and effective utilisation of waste, currently, and under a range of future scenarios. And finally, given how supply chains for waste are expanding, we can explore the impacts, both positive and negative, the scaling up of innovations has on addressing nexus goals.

					<h3>Anaerobic Digestion</h3>
					<p>
					Anaerobic digestion involves harnessing a natural process whereby organic matter is broken down by bacteria in the absence of oxygen to produce biogas. This can then be used as a renewable energy source, both for heat and power. Alternatively, the carbon dioxide and other impurities can be removed to produce biomethane which can be used as a transport fuel or injected into the gas grid. The treated material (or digestate) can be used as a fertiliser and soil conditioner.

					<h3>Insect Protein</h3>
					<p>
					Insects offer a rich source of protein and can happily feed on food waste. They are one of the most efficient converters of feed into protein and can be consumed both by humans and animals. There is an increasing interest in using them to supplant animal protein for human consumption or the huge quantities of soy which are imported to feed animals during winter (soy all too often being grown on land cleared of rainforest).
					</p>

					<h3>Redistribution of surplus food</h3>
					<p>
					The diversion of food from a potential waste stream to people’s plates is exemplified by charities such as FareShare. The interception of food that is perfectly edible before it is thrown away is a great example of closing the loop on a waste stream: how much extra food would need to be grown to feed those same people if it were not diverted from waste?

				<h2>Pillars of Sustainability</h2>
				<p>Sustainability is often understood in relation to three major pillars: Economic, Social and Environmental. Sustainability indicators can fit into one or more of these categories.</p>

				<h2>Future Scenarios</h2>
				<p>What would the future look like? Our approach to sustainability innovations and interpreting the indicators might change depending on the circumstances at hand. We examine three possible scenarios.</p>
				<section id="bns">
					<h3>Big 'n' Smart</h3>
					<h4>Coordinated climate change action reduces impacts on water, energy and food.</h4>
					<p>
Strategic alliances with businesses in countries such as Germany and Japan support investment in large infrastructural projects and attracts associated
skills, practices and technologies into the UK. Extensive upgrades in energy and water networks, as well as transport and housing, deliver efficiency
improvements. Parallel advances in mobile technologies, data collection and remote control change the face of production and service provision.
Decision-making is expert-led but the results work well for the majority of UK citizens. Despite being committed to limiting climate change to 2 degrees,
the time taken to deliver the UK's 'big fixes' means that the possibility of meeting Paris climate change targets has passed.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="cnc">
					<h3>Create 'n' Cope</h3>
					<h4>Turbulent times spark a lively patchwork of experiments in service provision.</h4>
					<p>
Climate impacts are felt sooner and more strongly than expected, at least in some areas of the UK. Under-investment in efforts to adapt and mitigate
earlier in the century mean that centralised infrastructure now struggles to maintain the services that consumers have come to expect. However,
insecurity prompts innovation and carves out considerable space for new entrants to supply energy, food and water services to consumers. Organisations
both large and small, experiment with novel on-site solutions to manage supplies while the national Government increases the flow of funding to Local
Authorities who, along with other investors, support creative thinkers in identifying social enterprise opportunities and business ventures.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="snc">
					<h3>Share 'n' Connect</h3>
					<h4>Accessible technology and social networks enable decentralised climate action.</h4>
					<p>
Extensive climate action, in-line with the Paris Agreement, prompts changes in water, energy and food systems. Individuals, communities, and
small businesses lead social and technological experimentation, designing context-specific solutions to meet local challenges. Centralised
planning and big business help roll-out mature innovations, though with high levels of collaboration and a cultural patience for uncertainty.
Agility, diversity, and adaptation are the dominant characteristics of this society, with different ‘solutions’ springing up in different places,
depending on specific local needs and opportunities. However collaboration aids the diffusion of innovation and avoids any duplication of effort.

				<h2>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</h2>
				<p>The UN Sustainable Development goals address the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. Indicators can be linked to these overarching global goals. Find out more <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
